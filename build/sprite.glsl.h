    Overview:

        Shader program 'sprite_program':
            Get shader desc: sprite_program_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: sprite_vs
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_sprite_vs_position = 0
                    ATTR_sprite_vs_texcoord = 1
                    ATTR_sprite_vs_color = 2
            Fragment shader: sprite_fs
                Image 'sprite':
                    Type: SG_IMAGETYPE_2D
                    Component Type: SG_SAMPLERTYPE_FLOAT
                    Bind slot: SLOT_sprite = 0


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader sprite_program = sg_make_shader(sprite_program_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'sprite_vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_sprite_vs_position] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_sprite_vs_texcoord] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_sprite_vs_color] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]

        SLOT_sprite = 0;
